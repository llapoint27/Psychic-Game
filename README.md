Description:
The Psychic Game is a game between you and the Psychic (a.k.a the computer). Try to guess what letter she is thinking. You have 9 guesses. If you guess correctly, you win and receive a point. If you run out of guesses, you lose. Once you run out of guesses, the game resets and you get another chance to exercise your psychic abilities. Enjoy!
